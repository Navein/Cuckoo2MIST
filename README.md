## About

The Malware Instruction Set (MIST) is a representation for monitored behavior
of malicious software. The representation is optimized for effective and
efficient analysis of behavior using data mining and machine learning
techniques. It can be obtained automatically during analysis of malware with a
behavior monitoring tool or by converting existing behavior reports. The
representation is not restricted to a particular monitoring tool and thus can
also be used as a meta language to unify behavior reports of different sources.

A detailed description and technical background on the concept of MIST is provided in  the following article:

- "A Malware Instruction Set for Behavior-Based Analysis." Philipp Trinius, Carsten Willems, Thorsten Holz, and Konrad Rieck Technical report TR-2009-07, University of Mannheim, 2009

This framework converts Cuckoo Sandbox behaviour reports into MIST format.

## Package Installation

Install Python dependency

```
pip install setuptools
```

Install package

```
$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install
```

setup.py will install murmurhash3 and pymp dependency.
If successful, import package to python

```
>> import cuckoo2mist
```

## Usage

```
$ cuckoo2mist -c [directory of custom configuration files, omit to use default configuration] -i [directory of Cuckoo logs] -o [directory where MIST reports should be saved]
```

or for direct execution from source directory without installation:

```
$ python run-cuckoo2mist.py -c [directory of custom configuration files, omit to use default configuration] -i [directory of Cuckoo logs] -o [directory where MIST reports should be saved]
```

## Updates

**Changes in this fork**

In version 0.3:

1. More API calls are added.
2. More MIST levels added.
3. Order of API calls are retained by using python ordered dictionary.
4. ELF hash is changed to Murmurhash3 (mmh3 2.5.1) and it is installed as dependency.

In version 0.4:

1. Update on codebase to allow usage from console after installation.
2. cuckoo2mist can now open and read JSON reports which are compressed with gzip format.
3. All actions are now logged, for better tracking of issues during operation.
4. Log file is now saved in user directory.
5. The matching of API parameters is now case insensitive.
6. Minor code mistakes corrected.

In version 0.4.1:

1. cuckoo_elements2mist.xml is updated to include API calls which are commonly used by malware, and important arguments in the respective APIs are set to level 2, for better generalization of behaviour.

In version 0.4.2:

1. API calls with A (ANSI) or W (Unicode) trailing are generalised into calls without the trailing character.
2. MIST conversion scipt is speed up by applying multithreading processing using pymp, which is added as dependency.
3. Added URL processing. URL is now split into two parts: domain and parameters. The two parts are placed on the same MIST level.

**Upcoming changes**

1. Per-file MIST conversion & removal of generated MIST reports.
2. URL module will be added to better handle URLs.
3. More filters will be added to filter and refine MIST format.
4. A module to utilise API handles will be added to support more types of analysis.

Work on cuckoo2MIST is still ongoing. Contributors are welcomed to help improve this framework.
